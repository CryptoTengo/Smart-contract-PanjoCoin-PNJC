The narrative layer is a cultural engagement mechanism and does not represent financial guarantees or investment expectations.

---

# 5. Token Utility

PNJC provides the following utility functions:

* DAO governance participation
* staking mechanisms
* ecosystem rewards distribution
* access to digital ecosystem features
* participation in community governance proposals

# 6. Tokenomics

| Parameter    | Value             |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Standard     | ERC-20            |
| Chain        | Polygon           |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000,000 |
| Mintable     | No                |
| Burnable     | Yes               |

### Allocation

* Liquidity: 50%
* Treasury: 12%
* DAO Treasury: 10%
* Core Team: 10%
* Community: 8%
* Founder: 5%
* Charity Reserve: 5%

# 7. Smart Contract Specification

## Core Contract Functions

| Function       | Type      | Description        |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| transfer()     | ERC-20    | Token transfer     |
| approve()      | ERC-20    | Allowance approval |
| transferFrom() | ERC-20    | Delegated transfer |
| burn()         | Extension | Token destruction  |

## Administrative Controls

* Ownership: Ownable (initial admin)
* Minting: Disabled permanently
* Upgradeability: Not enabled (immutable deployment)

---

# 8. Security Model

Security is enforced through:

* OpenZeppelin audited libraries
* immutable supply design
* multisignature treasury wallets
* hardware-based key management
* bug bounty program

---

# 9. Threat Model (Security Analysis)

## 9.1 Identified Risks

* Smart contract vulnerabilities (ERC-20 standard risks)
* Private key compromise (admin or treasury wallets)
* Bridge or DEX dependency risks (Polygon ecosystem)
* Governance manipulation via token concentration

## 9.2 Mitigation Strategies

* removal of mint functions (supply immutability)
* multisig treasury control
* timelocked administrative actions (planned)
* audit requirement before upgrades
* gradual decentralization of governance power

---

# 10. Token Flow Architecture

## Standard Lifecycle

1. User acquires PNJC on DEX
2. Tokens enter wallet (ERC-20 custody)
3. User may:

   * stake tokens
   * vote in governance
   * transfer tokens
   * hold long-term

## Ecosystem Flow

Buy → Hold → Stake → Vote → Reward Distribution → Optional Burn Events

---

# 11. Governance Model (DAO)

* Proposal Threshold: 0.5% staked supply
* Quorum: 5% staked supply
* Voting Period: 5–7 days

DAO controls:

* treasury allocation
* ecosystem incentives
* protocol parameters

---

# 12. Treasury Management

Treasury operations require:

* multisig approval
* DAO governance approval (for large allocations)
* on-chain transparency

---

# 13. Restricted Jurisdictions

PNJC is not available in jurisdictions where digital asset activity is restricted or prohibited under applicable law or sanctions regimes.

Restricted regions include:

* United States
* China

# 14. Risk Disclosure

Users acknowledge risks including:

* extreme market volatility
* regulatory uncertainty
* smart contract vulnerabilities
* liquidity risks
* infrastructure dependency risks

---

# 15. Roadmap

Phase 1: Deployment & Branding
Phase 2: Audit & DEX Listing
Phase 3: Staking & DAO Launch
Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion
Phase 5: Multi-chain & CEX readiness

---

# 16. Conclusion

PanjoCoin (PNJC) is a utility-driven memecoin designed to function as a decentralized coordination asset for community governance and ecosystem participation.

---

# Appendix A — Token Summary
