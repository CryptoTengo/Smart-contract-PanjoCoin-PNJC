/**
 * @title PanjoCoin (PNJC) - High-Performance Polygon Implementation
 * @author PanjoCoin Engineering Team
 * 
 * @notice ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
 * This contract is a professional-grade ERC20 implementation specifically 
 * optimized for the Polygon ecosystem. It features EIP-2612 (Permit) 
 * for gasless approvals and a burnable mechanism for deflationary utility.
 *
 * @dev AUDIT & INVESTOR KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
 * 1. ZERO INFLATION: Total supply is hard-capped at 1 Trillion tokens. 
 *    No minting capabilities exist post-deployment.
 * 2. TRUSTLESS DESIGN: The contract lacks administrative roles (No Owner, No Admin). 
 *    This eliminates 'Rug Pull' risks as no one can pause or modify the contract.
 * 3. POLYGON OPTIMIZED: Uses Solidity 0.8.34 with 'shanghai' or 'paris' EVM target 
 *    to ensure full compatibility with Polygon's node architecture.
 * 4. EIP-2612 INTEGRATION: Permits allow for seamless integration with Polygon 
 *    DEXs (like QuickSwap), enabling signature-based interactions.
